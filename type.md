In PowerShell, the `Type` command is used to display the contents of a text file. Itâ€™s an alias for the `Get-Content` cmdlet.

### Basic syntax:

```powershell
Type <file_path>
```

### Example:

```powershell
Type C:\Users\Example\file.txt
```

This will output the contents of `file.txt` to the console.

Alternatively, you can use the full cmdlet:

```powershell
Get-Content C:\Users\Example\file.txt
```

Both commands work the same for reading and displaying text file contents.

Want me to show how to do this for other file types or with additional options?
