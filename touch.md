Got it! Here’s a quick rundown of the `touch` command in Linux and its PowerShell equivalent on Windows.

### `touch` Command (Linux)

**Purpose:**
Creates an empty file or updates the timestamp (access and modification time) of an existing file.

---

**Basic Usage:**

```bash
touch filename.txt
```

* If `filename.txt` doesn’t exist, it creates a new empty file.
* If it exists, it updates the file’s last modified timestamp to the current time.

### PowerShell Equivalent on Windows

PowerShell doesn’t have a direct `touch` command, but you can achieve the same effect.

---

**To create a new empty file (like `touch`):**

```powershell
New-Item -Path filename.txt -ItemType File
```

If the file already exists, this will throw an error.

---

**To create or update the timestamp (like `touch`):**

```powershell
# If file doesn't exist, create it; if it does, update last write time
if (Test-Path filename.txt) {
    (Get-Item filename.txt).LastWriteTime = Get-Date
} else {
    New-Item -Path filename.txt -ItemType File
}
```

---

**Shortcut (PowerShell 5.1+):**

You can also do this in one line:

```powershell
Set-Content filename.txt -Value $null -NoNewline
```

This updates the file timestamp if it exists; if not, it creates an empty file.
