 
`rm` is used to **remove (delete) files or directories** in Linux. Here's a quick overview of how to use it safely:

### Basic Usage

* Remove a file:

```bash
rm filename
```

* Remove multiple files:

```bash
rm file1 file2 file3
```

### Remove directories

By default, `rm` cannot remove directories unless you add the `-r` (recursive) option:

```bash
rm -r directoryname
```

This deletes the directory and all its contents (files and subdirectories).

### Common useful options:

* `-i` — interactive mode, prompts before deleting each file
* `-f` — force delete, ignore nonexistent files and do not prompt
* `-r` or `-R` — recursive delete (for directories)

### Examples:

* Remove a file safely with confirmation:

```bash
rm -i file.txt
```

* Force remove a directory and all contents without prompts:

```bash
rm -rf foldername
```

### ⚠️ Warning:

Be very careful with `rm -rf` — it **permanently deletes files and directories without moving to Trash**, and recovery can be difficult or impossible.
