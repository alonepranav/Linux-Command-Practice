### `cat` â€” Concatenate and Display Files

* **Purpose:** Reads and displays the contents of files to the terminal. It can also combine files.

---

### Basic Usage

```bash
cat filename
```

This outputs the content of `filename` to your terminal screen.

---

### Examples

* Display a file called `notes.txt`:

  ```bash
  cat notes.txt
  ```

* Display multiple files one after another:

  ```bash
  cat file1.txt file2.txt
  ```

* Create a new file by typing text (press Ctrl+D to end input):

  ```bash
  cat > newfile.txt
  ```

* Append content of one file to another:

  ```bash
  cat file1.txt >> file2.txt
  ```

---

### Why use `cat`?

* Quickly view the contents of small text files.
* Combine files.
* Create files (via terminal input).

---

### Tips

* For very large files, better to use `less` or `more` to scroll comfortably:

  ```bash
  less filename
  ```

### More about `cat`

* The name **`cat`** comes from **concatenate**, meaning it can join files together as well as display them.
* It reads files sequentially and outputs them.

---

### Common Options

* `-n` : Number all output lines

  ```bash
  cat -n filename
  ```

* `-b` : Number only non-blank lines

  ```bash
  cat -b filename
  ```

* `-s` : Squeeze multiple adjacent blank lines into one

  ```bash
  cat -s filename
  ```

---

### Examples

* Number lines when displaying:

  ```bash
  cat -n script.sh
  ```

* Combine two files into a new one:

  ```bash
  cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt
  ```

* Append one file to another:

  ```bash
  cat file1.txt >> file2.txt
  ```

* Create a file by typing input (press Ctrl+D when done):

  ```bash
  cat > newfile.txt
  This is some text.
  Ctrl+D
  ```

### When not to use `cat`

* For viewing large files, better use `less` or `more` so you can scroll page-by-page.
* To view the beginning of a file, use `head`.
* To view the end, use `tail`.

Want me to help you practice or explain those commands (`head`, `tail`, `less`)? Or anything else on `cat`?
