`pwd` stands for **Print Working Directory**.

In Linux (and other Unix-like systems), when you type:

```bash
pwd
```

it **displays the full absolute path** of the current directory you’re in.

### Example:

If you’re inside the folder `/home/user/documents/projects`, running `pwd` will output:

```
/home/user/documents/projects
```

It’s useful to confirm your current location in the filesystem before running commands like `rm` or `ls`.
