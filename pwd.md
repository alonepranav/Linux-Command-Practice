## ðŸ”¹ `pwd` â€“ Print Working Directory

In Linux (and other Unix-like systems), the `pwd` command **displays the full absolute path** of your current working directory.

### ðŸ“Œ Syntax:

```bash
pwd
```

### ðŸ§¾ Example:

If youâ€™re inside the folder `/home/user/documents/projects`, running:

```bash
pwd
```

will output:

```
/home/user/documents/projects
```

### ðŸ’¡ Why Use It?

* Confirms **where you are** in the filesystem.
* Helpful before running commands like `rm`, `cd`, or `ls`.
