It looks like you want to know about the `tree` command in Linux. Here's a quick overview:

---

### What is the `tree` command?

`tree` is a Linux command-line utility that displays the contents of a directory in a tree-like format. It shows files and directories recursively, making it easy to visualize the folder structure.

---

### Basic Usage

```bash
tree
```

This will print the directory structure of the current directory.

---

### Common Options

* `tree -L <level>`
  Limit the depth of the directory tree displayed. For example, `tree -L 2` shows only two levels deep.

* `tree -a`
  Show all files, including hidden files (those starting with a dot).

* `tree -d`
  List only directories.

* `tree -f`
  Print the full path prefix for each file.

* `tree -h`
  Print the size of each file in a human-readable format.

---

### Example

```bash
tree -L 2 -a
```

This shows all files and directories up to two levels deep, including hidden files.

---

### Installation

If `tree` is not installed by default, you can install it using your package manager:

* Debian/Ubuntu:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install tree
  ```

* Fedora:

  ```bash
  sudo dnf install tree
  ```

* Arch Linux:

  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S tree
  ```

Would you like me to show an example of the output or how to use it in a script?
