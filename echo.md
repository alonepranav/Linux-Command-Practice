Awesome! Let’s dive into **`echo`**, a super useful and simple command.

---

### `echo` — Display a Line of Text

* **Purpose:** Prints text or variables to the terminal (standard output).

---

### Basic Usage

```bash
echo "Your text here"
```

This will print whatever you put inside the quotes.

---

### Examples

* Print a simple message:

  ```bash
  echo "Hello, Linux!"
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  Hello, Linux!
  ```

* Print without quotes (quotes are usually needed only if your text has spaces):

  ```bash
  echo Hello
  ```

* Print the value of a variable:

  ```bash
  NAME="Alice"
  echo "My name is $NAME"
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  My name is Alice
  ```

* Print special characters or escape sequences (like newline `\n`):

  ```bash
  echo -e "Line1\nLine2"
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  Line1
  Line2
  ```

---

### Useful options

* `-e` : Enable interpretation of backslash escapes (like `\n` for newline, `\t` for tab).
* `-n` : Do not print the trailing newline (keeps the cursor on the same line).

Example:

```bash
echo -n "Enter your name: "
```

---

### Summary

* `echo` is great for displaying messages.
* You can print variables, special characters, or static text.
* Commonly used in scripts for output.
